time complexity is the time taken  when the input also increases.
it is like a graph between time and size and
time complexity is  a function between time and size   which tells how the time will grow when increased in size.

O(1)<O(log(n))<O(n)<O(n^2)<O(n^3)

space complexity is equals of the recursion problems is the height of the tree.
auxiliary space is the extra space which the program required

Height of the tree is equals to the height from the root node to the child node.


two types of recursions linear and divide and conquer
